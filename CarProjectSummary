You can open the link and see my codes with Java 8.
There are 4 classes, Car, CarDealer, CarSorter and Main.
In Car class I put my variables using encapsulation so that I can use them in other classes.
In CarDealer class I put my cars and their features in a List to find the functionality in the questions.
In Carsorter class I sorted my Lists using Collections class with Lambda expressions.
In Main class I have my main method and I run the methods from CarSorter class.
